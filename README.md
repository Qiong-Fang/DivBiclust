1. DataSets

Nine scRNA-Seq datasets are used in our paper, which are called the HCC, HEC, HPIC, HUM1-4, and MOU1-2 datasets. Three smaller datasets HCC, HEC, and HPIC can be downloaded from https://www.github.com/Qiong-Fang/DivBiclust/. The other six larger datasets can be downloaded from: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lApKznoUXTpQfMQO0KPIHw
