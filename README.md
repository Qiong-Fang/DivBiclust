# DivBiclust


1. DataSets

Nine scRNA-Seq datasets are used in our paper, which are called the HCC, HEC, HPIC, HUM1-4, and MOU1-2 datasets. Three smaller datasets HCC, HEC, and HPIC can be downloaded from https://www.github.com/Qiong-Fang/DivBiclust/. The other six larger datasets can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bsKLf3EuYGvPZwPS0rXX7dgnMheHxUS6?usp=sharing

DivBiclust is implemented using C++ on Visual Studio 2015.
